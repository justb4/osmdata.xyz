# osmdata.xyz | global osm extracts
This project provides global data extracts based on [OpenStreetMap data](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/) as [GeoPackages](https://www.geopackage.org/). Each extract represents its related [primary feature](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) respectively key value regarding the [OpenStreetMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Every GeoPackage contains the four types of geometries: point, line, multilinestring and multipolygon. For each primary feature all prepared tags are always contained in the same way.

## Extracts are available on
https://download.osmdata.xyz/

In a monthly cycle new extracts are provided. The first Planet Dump of each month from openstreetmap.org will be available 3 days later as it takes a while for the data to be processed.

Projection of the geodata: WGS 84 | EPSG 4326 | https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/

## Why
OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers an amazing collection of data. The information contained provides many possibilities to better understand the geogrpahy of the world, e.g. with the use of a geographic information system (GIS). There are many tools to create small extracts from OSM data: overpass-turbo (API) or other tools in QGIS/ArcGIS. A bigger challenge is creating ready to use GIS-compatible data sets from OSM, which cover whole countries, continents or even the whole world.

osmdata.xyz is my hobby and absolutely non-commercial. I'm happy to share open data, knowledge and insights.

## Utilized tools to create extracts
Workflow: https://github.com/michaelmgis/osmdata.xyz/tree/master/workflow_scripts

- osmium --> https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/
- gdal / ogr2ogr --> https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html

Archive | old [workflows](https://github.com/michaelmgis/osmdata.xyz/tree/master/archive)
- imposm3 --> https://github.com/omniscale/imposm3 (see since 20190805)
- PostGIS / PostgreSQL --> https://postgis.net/
- osm2pgsql --> https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql)

## Data basis
- primary (map) features --> https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features
- planet file as osm.pbf --> https://planet.openstreetmap.org/

## Using Docker
See the [docker Readme](docker/README.md).

## Recent improvements and changes

- 03.2021
  - **BIG UPDATE** will be implemented in March - adressing [Issue #25](https://github.com/michaelmgis/osmdata.xyz/issues/25): Switching from imposm/PostgreSQL to gdal/ogr2ogr for processing. Data model stays the same.
  - Adding hstore field "other_tags" which contains all keys and tags who are related to the primary mapfeatues but not listed as main keys/tags.
  - public_transport with relations included (e.g. routes of buses)
- 02.2021
  - adressing [Issue #16](https://github.com/michaelmgis/osmdata.xyz/issues/16) --> adding tents
- 01.2021
  - adressing [Issue #23](https://github.com/michaelmgis/osmdata.xyz/issues/23)
  - adding a new extract to the [workflow](https://github.com/michaelmgis/osmdata.xyz/blob/master/workflow_scripts/99_public_transport_with_relations)  [public_transport_with_relations_EPSG4326.zip](https://download.osmdata.xyz/data/public_transport_with_relations_EPSG4326.zip)
- 10.2020
  - adding osm_id as key [Issue 21](https://github.com/michaelmgis/osmdata.xyz/issues/21); more information at [imposm docs](https://imposm.org/docs/imposm3/latest/mapping.html#id)
- 05.2020
  - Providing ZIP-Files as Downloads. Switching back from 7zip to ZIP for better compatibility and usability.
- 04.2020
  - Adressing [Issue 18](https://github.com/michaelmgis/osmdata.xyz/issues/18) for more compatibility
  - colon (:) to underline in attribute names and renaming "natural" to "natural_attribute".
  - ~~Adressing [Issue 19](https://github.com/michaelmgis/osmdata.xyz/issues/19) by swithing to [7zip-archive](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) format.~~
- 01.2020
  - [docker workflow](https://github.com/michaelmgis/osmdata.xyz/tree/master/docker)
- 10.2019
  - definition of geometrytype improve reading the content of a GeoPackage with QGIS
  - new tags: internet_access, wifi
- 08.2019
  - all geometries of each map feature are stored in one GeoPackage
  - new processing chain - imposm3 is used since the extracts from 20190805 - see [workflow_scripts](https://github.com/michaelmgis/osmdata.xyz/tree/master/workflow_scripts).
